## R and Shiny Empowering Mixology Exploration

- The world of mixology is vast, with countless cocktail possibilities. As aspiring programmers, we saw an opportunity to blend technology with mixology to create a unique and interactive experience.

- **R Language:**
    - Enabled efficient data processing.
    - Facilitated seamless integration with our mixology dataset.
    - Facilitated dynamic exploration of 600 curated cocktails.

- **Shiny App:**
    - Provided an interactive platform for users to explore cocktails.
    - Bridged the gap between mixology knowledge and technology.
    - Transformed our vision into an engaging user interface.
    - Enabled users to discover, search, and receive personalized cocktail recommendations.

## Our motivation

- **Project Inspiration:**
  - Fueled by a desire to merge technology and mixology, our vision was to create a practical tool that empowers users to explore the world of cocktails effortlessly.

- **Practicality:**
    - We aimed to develop a tool that users can immediately apply to enhance their mixology experience.
    - Practicality guided our decisions, ensuring the project remained feasible within the given timeframe and our R and Shiny expertise.

- **Learning Journey:**
    - Motivated by the opportunity to delve into R and Shiny, our project served as a valuable learning experience.
    - We embraced the challenge of combining programming skills with mixology, expanding our knowledge in both domains.

## Overview of the drinks dataset

- Drink names: a variety of drink names, indicating diverse beverages
- Alcoholic content: specifies whether a drink is alcoholic or non-alcoholic
- Image URLs: ULRs to images of the drinks
- Ingredients and measures: detailed lists of ingredients and measures
- Over 40 columns and over 500 cocktails offered
- Preparation steps for creating a cocktail

## Understanding ingredients and measurements structure


1. Dynamic Column Creation: Starts with the first cocktail; columns added as per ingredients.
2. Sequential Addition: New cocktails fill existing columns if they have equal or fewer ingredients.
3. Expansion for More Ingredients: Additional columns created for cocktails with more ingredients.
4. Parallel Structure for Measurements: 15 corresponding columns for measurements align with ingredients.
5. Cumulative Column Growth: Reflects the cocktail with the highest number of ingredients.
6. Flexible and Comprehensive: Ensures accommodation of cocktails with varying ingredients.

# Creating a data frame
cocktail_data <- data.frame(
  Cocktail = c("Cocktail 1", "Cocktail 2", "Cocktail 3"),
  Ingredient_1 = c("Lime", "Raspberry", "Cranberry"),
  Ingredient_2 = c("Vodka", "Beer", "Orange Juice"),
  Ingredient_3 = c("N/A", "N/A", "Rum")
)

kable(cocktail_data, format = "html", 
      col.names = c("Cocktail", "Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2", "Ingredient 3"),
      align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE) 
  
```

## Data wrangling: encoding

- Hot encoding of ingredients: transitioned from 15 columns containing ingredients without a specific order to one column per ingredient
- Encoding method: used the measurement as the value when an ingredient is present, NA otherwise
- Handling diverse measurements: kept measurements in their original string format

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Creating a data frame
cocktail_data2 <- data.frame(
  Cocktail = c("Cocktail 1", "Cocktail 2"),
  Ingredient_1 = c("Lime", "Grape Juice"),
  Ingredient_2 = c("Vodka", "Beer")
)

# Displaying the table using kable with formatting
kable(cocktail_data2, format = "html", 
      col.names = c("Cocktail", "Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2"),
      align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Creating a data frame
cocktail_data3 <- data.frame(
  Cocktail = c("Cocktail 1", "Cocktail 2"),
  Measure_1 = c("1/2", "50 ml"),
  Measure_2 = c("1 1/3 cup", "0.7 oz")
)

# Displaying the table using kable with formatting
kable(cocktail_data3, format = "html", 
      col.names = c("Cocktail", "Measure 1", "Measure 2"),
      align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE)

```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)

# Creating a data frame
cocktail_data4 <- data.frame(
  Cocktail = c("Cocktail 1", "Cocktail 2"),
  Lime = c("1/2", "N/A"),
  Grape_juice = c("N/A", "50 ml"),
  Vodka = c("1 1/3 cup", "N/A"),
  Beer = c("N/A", "0.7 oz")
)

# Displaying the table using kable with formatting
kable(cocktail_data4, format = "html", 
      col.names = c("Cocktail", "Lime", "Grape Juice", "Vodka", "Beer"),
      align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE)

```

## Data wrangling: unit homogenization

- Measurements are Initially encountered in various formats like ‘1 ½ oz', '1/2 cup', '0.5', ‘1 ml' etc.
- Each number is accompanied by a measurement unit, with over 90 different unit options
- Homogenization to Decimals/Entire number: Standardized all measurements to decimal or entire format for consistency
- We do this step to make it easier to convert units using the R package, enabling data manipulation

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

kable(cocktail_data4, format = "html", 
      col.names = c("Cocktail", "Lime", "Grape Juice", "Vodka", "Beer"),
      align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE, position="center")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(knitr)

# Creating a data frame
cocktail_data5 <- data.frame(
  Cocktail = c("Cocktail 1", "Cocktail 2"),
  Lime = c("0.5", "N/A"),
  Grape_juice = c("N/A", "50 ml"),
  Vodka = c("1.33 cup", "N/A"),
  Beer = c("N/A", "0.7 oz")
)

# Displaying the table using kable with formatting
kable(cocktail_data5, format = "html", 
      col.names = c("Cocktail", "Lime", "Grape Juice", "Vodka", "Beer"),
      align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE,position="center")
